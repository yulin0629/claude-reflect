A self-learning system for Claude Code that captures corrections, positive feedback, and preferences — then syncs them to CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.

## What it does

When you correct Claude Code during a session ("no, use gpt-5.1 not gpt-5", "use database for caching"), these corrections are captured and can be added to your CLAUDE.md files so Claude remembers them in future sessions.

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  You correct    │ ──► │  Hook captures  │ ──► │  /reflect adds  │
│  Claude Code    │     │  to queue       │     │  to CLAUDE.md   │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
      (automatic)            (automatic)            (manual review)
```

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add bayramannakov/claude-reflect

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install claude-reflect@claude-reflect-marketplace

# IMPORTANT: Restart Claude Code to activate the plugin
```

After installation, **restart Claude Code** (exit and reopen). Then hooks auto-configure and commands are ready.

> **First run?** When you run `/reflect` for the first time, you'll be prompted to scan your past sessions for learnings.

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed
- Python 3.6+ (included on most systems)

### Platform Support

- **macOS**: Fully supported
- **Linux**: Fully supported
- **Windows**: Fully supported (native Python, no WSL required)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/reflect` | Process queued learnings with human review |
| `/reflect --scan-history` | Scan ALL past sessions for missed learnings |
| `/reflect --dry-run` | Preview changes without applying |
| `/reflect --targets` | Show detected config files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) |
| `/reflect --review` | Show queue with confidence scores and decay status |
| `/reflect --dedupe` | Find and consolidate similar entries in CLAUDE.md |
| `/reflect-skills` | **NEW** Discover skill candidates from repeating patterns |
| `/skip-reflect` | Discard all queued learnings |
| `/view-queue` | View pending learnings without processing |

## How It Works

### Two-Stage Process

**Stage 1: Capture (Automatic)**

Hooks run automatically to detect and queue corrections:

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `capture_learning.py` | Every prompt | Detects correction patterns and queues them |
| `check_learnings.py` | Before compaction | Backs up queue and informs user |
| `post_commit_reminder.py` | After git commit | Reminds to run /reflect after completing work |

**Stage 2: Process (Manual)**

Run `/reflect` to review and apply queued learnings to CLAUDE.md.

### Detection Methods

Claude-reflect uses a **hybrid detection approach**:

**1. Regex patterns (real-time capture)**

Fast pattern matching during sessions detects:

- **Corrections**: `"no, use X"` / `"don't use Y"` / `"actually..."` / `"that's wrong"`
- **Positive feedback**: `"Perfect!"` / `"Exactly right"` / `"Great approach"`
- **Explicit markers**: `"remember:"` — highest confidence

**2. Semantic AI validation (during /reflect)**

When you run `/reflect`, an AI-powered semantic filter:
- **Multi-language support** — understands corrections in any language
- **Better accuracy** — filters out false positives from regex
- **Cleaner learnings** — extracts concise, actionable statements

Example: A Spanish correction like `"no, usa Python"` is correctly detected even though it doesn't match English patterns.

Each captured learning has a **confidence score** (0.60-0.95). The final score is the higher of regex and semantic confidence.

### Human Review

When you run `/reflect`, Claude presents a summary table with options:
- **Apply** - Accept the learning and add to CLAUDE.md
- **Edit before applying** - Modify the learning text first
- **Skip** - Don't apply this learning

### Multi-Target Sync

Approved learnings are synced to:
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global - applies to all projects)
- `./CLAUDE.md` (project-specific)
- `./**/CLAUDE.md` (subdirectories - auto-discovered)
- `./commands/*.md` (skill files - when correction relates to a skill)
- `AGENTS.md` (if exists - works with Codex, Cursor, Aider, Jules, Zed, Factory)

Run `/reflect --targets` to see which files will be updated.

### Skill Discovery (NEW in v2.2.0)

Run `/reflect-skills` to discover repeating patterns in your sessions that could become reusable skills:

```
/reflect-skills              # Analyze last 14 days
/reflect-skills --days 30    # Analyze last 30 days
```

Features:
- **AI-powered detection** — uses reasoning, not regex, to find patterns
- **Semantic similarity** — detects same intent across different phrasings
- **Generates skill files** — creates draft skills in `./commands/`

### Skill Improvement Routing (NEW in v2.2.0)

When you correct Claude while using a skill (e.g., `/deploy`), the correction can be routed back to the skill file itself:

```
User: /deploy
Claude: [deploys without running tests]
User: "no, always run tests before deploying"

→ /reflect detects this relates to /deploy
→ Offers to add learning to commands/deploy.md
→ Skill file updated with new step
```

This makes skills smarter over time, not just CLAUDE.md.

## Upgrading

### From v2.0.x or earlier

If you see errors like "Duplicate hooks file detected" or "No such file or directory" after updating, you need to clear the plugin cache. This is due to known Claude Code caching issues:
- [#14061](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14061) - `/plugin update` doesn't invalidate cache
- [#15369](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/15369) - Uninstall doesn't clear cached files

```bash
# 1. Uninstall the plugin
claude plugin uninstall claude-reflect@claude-reflect-marketplace

# 2. Clear both caches (required!)
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-reflect-marketplace
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-reflect-marketplace

# 3. Exit Claude Code completely (restart terminal or close app)

# 4. Reinstall
claude plugin install claude-reflect@claude-reflect-marketplace
```

### Standard Update

For normal updates (when no cache issues):

```bash
# Use the /plugin menu in Claude Code
/plugin
# Select "Update now" for claude-reflect
```

## Uninstall

```bash
claude plugin uninstall claude-reflect@claude-reflect-marketplace
```

## Features

### Historical Scan

First time using claude-reflect? Run:

```bash
/reflect --scan-history
```

This scans all your past sessions for corrections you made, so you don't lose learnings from before installation.

### Smart Filtering

Claude filters out:
- Questions (not corrections)
- One-time task instructions
- Context-specific requests
- Vague/non-actionable feedback

Only reusable learnings are kept.

### Duplicate Detection

Before adding a learning, existing CLAUDE.md content is checked. If similar content exists, you can:
- Merge with existing entry
- Replace the old entry
- Skip the duplicate

### Semantic Deduplication

Over time, CLAUDE.md can accumulate similar entries. Run `/reflect --dedupe` to:
- Find semantically similar entries (even with different wording)
- Propose consolidated versions
- Clean up redundant learnings

Example:
```
Before:
  - Use gpt-5.1 for complex tasks
  - Prefer gpt-5.1 for reasoning
  - gpt-5.1 is better for hard problems

After:
  - Use gpt-5.1 for complex reasoning tasks
```

## Tips

1. **Use explicit markers** for important learnings:
   ```
   remember: always use venv for Python projects
   ```

2. **Run /reflect after git commits** - The hook reminds you, but make it a habit

3. **Historical scan on new machines** - When setting up a new dev environment:
   ```
   /reflect --scan-history --days 90
   ```

4. **Project vs Global** - Model names and general patterns go global; project-specific conventions stay in project CLAUDE.md
